Hi! I'm Shawn, a final-year Data Science student at [Ngee Ann Polytechnic](https://www.np.edu.sg/schools-courses/academic-schools/school-of-infocomm-technology/diploma-in-data-science). Back in 2018, I started building apps in Python and later discovered my interest in machine learning. Since then, I've had the opportunity to work with the [Defence Science & Technology Agency (DSTA)](https://dsta.gov.sg/) and the [Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) Singapore](https://www.mha.gov.sg/), solving problems with data.

When I'm not coding, I like giving back to the community via
volunteering. I work with local volunteer group Heartwarmers to set up the IT infrastructure for their [pop-up supermarket](https://pride.kindness.sg/pop-up-supermarket-lets-needy-choose-what-they-need/) where needy families can buy daily essentials at a highly discounted price. Recently, I also started [tutoring](https://www.instagram.com/p/C5sv8OFtWJW/) secondary school children in math together with the Boon Lay Youth Network.
